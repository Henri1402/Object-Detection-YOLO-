Smart Front Door Object Detection with RING Camera

This project connects a custom object detection model to a RING front door camera feed to automatically detect and classify objects such as cars, people, bikes, garbage trucks, dogs, and more. The goal is to turn a standard RING setup into a smarter home surveillance system using machine learning.

🔍 What It Does

Detects and classifies common front-door objects:
🚗 Cars
🚶 People
🚲 Bikes
🐶 Dogs
🛻 Garbage trucks
... and other customizable classes
Logs detections with timestamps
